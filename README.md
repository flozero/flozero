## Why I love chatGPT

Once upon a time, there was a cat named Whiskers Whiskers loved to play.

So, Whiskers' owner decided to buy him a ball of yarn to play with. But when they tried to unravel it, the yarn got tangled and seemed to go on forever. "This yarn is like trying to install a npm package," Whiskers' owner joked. "It just never ends!"

The end.
